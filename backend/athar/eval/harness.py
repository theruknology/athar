"""Evaluation harness: precision / recall / F1 against ground truth (SPEC §17).

`evaluate(seed, …)` generates (or loads) the estate for `seed`, normalises every month **in
memory** — no database, no ledger, no LLM — runs the rule engine and the scorer on the final
month, and compares what fired with `ground_truth.json`. It writes `eval/results-<seed>.json`;
`GET /eval` reads the held-out result through :func:`load_result`.

Tuning vs reporting (SPEC §17): constants are tuned on `ATHAR_SEED` and reported on
`ATHAR_EVAL_SEED`, which the constants never saw. This module is the one that knows which is
which, so it decides `EvalResult.held_out` and passes it to the sentence builder rather than
letting the sentence assume it — `results-42.json` used to describe the tuning seed as held out,
which is the claim SPEC §8.3 exists to prevent. Nothing here writes to the database, so the
module imports (and this file's metric arithmetic is unit-testable) without Postgres, without
Anvil and without the generator.

**What "flagged at ≥ High" compares.** Both sides of the comparison are held to the same
threshold: an identity is *flagged* when a rule fired on it at High or Critical, and a ground-truth
positive counts as a High+ positive when at least one of the rules the simulator recorded for it is
a High/Critical rule. `recall_all_positives` reports recall against *every* positive (including the
Low/Medium-only ones) so the stricter number is always visible in the result file.
